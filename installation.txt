INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------

The easiest way to install the library is to copy or symlink the directory
“src/countertree” inside the “boost” directory, where the Boost libraries
are located.

If this is not possible, create a directory called “boost”, and copy the
directory “countertree” inside it, and include the path where the “boost”
directory resides, in the list of directories for to find the include files.

The folders benchmarks_GCC_4.7, benchmarks_CLANG_3.3 and benchmarks_VC12CTP,
contain the programs to generate the results shown in the web pages.

Note that the benchmark results can vary a lot depending of the machine,
as well as significantly based on the size of the cache memory.

My intention for creating this library is for it to be useful to the
community of programmers.

I could use your help with improving it.  If you find any bug or problem,
or have an idea or a suggestion, please mail me, and help me in perfecting
it and making it more useful.
