    <span style="font-size: 16pt ;text-decoration: underline;">PROBLEM
      DESCRIPTION</span><br>
    <br>
    Until now, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">main problem</span> in the
    design of parallel algorithms over tree data structures had been the
    difficult to <span style="font-weight: bold;">assign the elements</span>
    stored in the tree between an <span style="font-weight: bold;">arbitrary
      number of threads</span>. With this library, <span style="font-weight: bold;">this
      problem is removed</span>. Now, it's time to face the next problems in the
    design of parallel algorithms.<br>
    <br>
    The main problem is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">lock contention
      when the number of threads grows</span>, in the operations which need an
    exclusive lock over the data structure ( insertion, deletion, modification
    ...). The lock contention appear when the number of threads doing&nbsp;
    exclusively operations with exclusive lock is between 4 to 8, depending of
    the HW used.<br>
    <br>
    In order to <span style="font-weight: bold;">talk about parallel algorithms</span>
    we have two kinds :<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Algorithms
        with lock contention</span> , when the number of threads grows.<br>
      b) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Algorithms without lock contention</span>&nbsp;
      when the number of threads grows.</div>
    <br>
    All the algorithms mentioned here, or are implemented or are designed on
    paper, for to be implemented in next versions. Some of them can be
    implemented immediately, but others need to modify the internal algorithm of
    the tree, in order to implement operations of split and join over trees.<br>
    <br>
    These new algorithms affect to the semantic of the functions, by
    example&nbsp; how to pass to the tree destructor the number of threads to
    use? The solution to these problems need a study in deep for to evaluate the
    options and select the best solution. In the documentation this is described
    in the point <a title="next improvements" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8437476/works/countertree_2.0/doc/P1.5_next_improvements.html#next_improvements">1.5.-
      Next Improvements</a><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 16pt ;text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTIONS</span><br>
    <br>
    This document&nbsp; expose my viewpoint about the problems and the possible
    solutions. It's only an opinion, open to new ideas <br>
    <br>
    With the trees we can find the next operations :<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">1.- CONSULT </span><br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Any number of threads can access
      simultaneously to the tree <span style="font-weight: bold;">without&nbsp;
        lock contention</span> problems.</div>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">2.- ACCESS TO
      THE ELEMENTS</span>. <br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Any number of threads can access
      simultaneously to the tree <span style="font-weight: bold;">without&nbsp;
        lock contention</span> problems, but without the access by position it
      is very difficult to distribute between an arbitrary number of threads,
      imagine a tree with 200000000 nodes and a Xeon Phis with 244 threads.)</div>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">3.- INSERTION
      AND DELETION. </span><br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> These operations present problems of <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">lock contentions</span> when the number of
      threads grow and intensive use.&nbsp; But there is a strategy in order to
      minimize the problem.<br>
      <br>
      If the number of operations is small, the problem is small too. But if you
      have a great number of operations, you have an algorithm for to resolve
      it.&nbsp; This algorithm need support from the tree algorithms, operations
      of split the tree ( we have sub trees ordered) and the join operations of
      ordered sub trees. (These operations don't be in the actual version of the
      algorithm, and I expect to include in the next versions, as comment in the
      point <a title="redesign" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8437476/works/countertree_2.0/doc/P1.5_next_improvements.html#redesign">1.5.2.-
        Redesign of the internal algorithm).</a><br>
      <br>
      The idea is split the main tree in several sub trees and each thread
      manages a sub tree. When all the threads finish the operations, we join
      all the trees obtaining a new main tree.<br>
      <br>
      You need to sort all the operations to do, and assign to each thread a
      range of operations. After this, split the tree between the number of
      threads and do all the operation over each sub tree. When finish, join the
      sub trees and it's done.</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img title="image1" alt="Insertions in the tree"
        src="files/arbol1.png"></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> In the picture you can see, we have 8
      operations to insert and we have 4 threads. The vector are the elements to
      insert and we have 4 threads.</div>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img title="split tree" alt="insertions in split trees"
        src="files/arbol2.png"></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Each sub tree have the same number of
      operations to do, and when finish, join the sub trees obtaining a new main
      tree.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">This algorithm</span> can be implemented
      with any number of threads <span style="font-weight: bold;">without lock
        contentions</span>.&nbsp; The operations of split and join the sub trees
      are similar in cost to the insertion or the deletion of a node in the
      tree.</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">4.- COPY AND
      DELETE THE TREE. </span><br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Actually the compilers are using an
      algorithm O(N) which clone the tree. Even with this algorithm, these
      operations spend a great time if the tree is big. <br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> I have designed on paper for to be
      implemented with the actual version of the counter trees.</div>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">• Parallel algorithm for to <span style="font-weight: bold;">copy
        and delete tree structures</span>. These algorithms work with any number
      of threads<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; without lock contentions problems<br>
      <br>
      • Parallel algorithms of <span style="font-weight: bold;">copy the tree
        from a vector, and copy a vector from the tree</span>. These algorithms
      work with any<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; number of threads without lock contentions problems</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">5.- UNION,
      INTERSECTION AND NON INTERSECTION OPERATIONS</span><br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> With the access by position it's <span style="font-weight: bold;">easy
        design parallel algorithms</span> for to do these operations , but have
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">lock contention</span> in the insertion
      of the result in the final data structure. With the operations of split
      and join the tree we can design these <span style="font-weight: bold;">algorithms
        without lock contentions</span>.</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    The <span style="font-weight: bold;">lock mechanism</span> of the library,
    in the operations with exclusive lock ( Insert, delete , modification),
    permit in safe mode the concurrency with operations without exclusive lock (
    read) in a part of the operation, trying to minimize the time of lock (you
    have a description in the point&nbsp;<a target="_blank" title="mutex" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8437476/works/countertree_2.0/doc/single_writer_multiple_readers_mutex.pdf">
      5.4.- Description of the single writer multiple reader mutex (pdf)</a>.
    This don't resolve the problem but try to minimize the problems of lock
    contentions.<br>
    <br>
    I think the <span style="font-weight: bold;">access by position is not a
      magic solution</span> to the problems of the trees, but I think provide a
    new perspective, and perhaps it would be interested to reevaluate the
    optimal algorithm ( performance, space used, flexibility ...), in many real
    situations, according to this new perspective.<br>

    and I will try to respond you<br>
